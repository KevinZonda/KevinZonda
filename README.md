## About Me

- I am currently a _MSc Advanced Computing_ student at _Imperial College London_.
- I just got my **B.Sc. Computer Science with Honours** degree from the _University of Birmingham_ with ***Class I, GPA 4.25, Weighted Overall 77.625%***.
- I previously worked as **_CPO @ Limit-LAB_** and _Architect & Dev @ Treehollow_.
- I have _understanding_ and _experience_ on **_Go_** and **C#**. I also work with _Java_, _Python_, _C_, _Powershell_, etc.
- I also have _experience_ on _RDBMS_ (e.g. **_MySQL_** and **_PostgreSQL_**) and _NoSQL_ (e.g. **_Redis_**).
  and am current doing _Cassandra_ and _MongoDB_ with _gorm_
- I speak **_Mandarin (zh-CN)_**, **_British English (en-GB)_**, _Chinglish (en-CN)_ and fairly little _Cantonese (zh-HK)_
- I can't _html_, _css_ and _JavaScript_, I feel sorry about this (but can do a little **_TypeScript_**)
- I use **_GoLand_**, **_Rider_**, **_Visual Studio_**, **_WebStorm_**, _IDEA_, _CLion_ & _QtCreator_ as my IDEs, and **_git_** as VCS
- I use **_macOS 14.7 arm64_**, _Windows 10 LTSC x64_, _Fedora x64_, _Debian x64_, _Ubuntu x64/arm64_ ~~and _Manjaro x64_~~ as my system environment ~~, BTW, I don't use Arch~~.
- I prefer thinner items, therefore business laptops would have higher probability to be chosen. I work with
  ~~_ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 6_~~ (broken 4 times in 1 year, retired), **_MacBook
  Air 2022 (M2)_**, **_DELL XPS 13 9370_**, _Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro (14'' AMD)_ ~~and _MSI GS66 2020_ (retired)~~ (Ordered by frequency
  of use)


## My Interest

- Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- Programming Language Theory
- Other: interested at _Mathematics_, _Public Health_ and _Epidemiology_, may try to get _MPH/PGDip/PGCert_ degree after finishing CS courses
