## About Me

- I am a VP of **ML team @ [KIGLAND](https://github.com/kigland)** also am **Alumni @ MiraclePlus** (formerly YC China) **S23 & S25**.
- I got **MSc Advanced Computing** (Distinction) from _Imperial College London_ and **B.Sc. Computer Science** with Honours, Class I from the _University of Birmingham_.
- I previously worked as _CPO @ Limit-LAB_ and _Architect & Dev @ Treehollow_.
- I have _understanding_ and _experience_ on **_Go_** and **C#**. I also work with _Java_, _Python_, _C_, _Powershell_, etc.
- I also have _experience_ on _RDBMS_ (e.g. **_MySQL_** and **_PostgreSQL_**) and _NoSQL_ (e.g. **_Redis_**).
- I speak **_Mandarin (zh-CN)_**, **_British English (en-GB)_**, _Chinglish (en-CN)_ and fairly little _Cantonese (zh-HK)_
- I can't _html_, _css_ and _JavaScript_, I feel sorry about this (but can do a little **_TypeScript_**)
- I use **_GoLand_**, **_Rider_**, **_Visual Studio_**, **_WebStorm_**, _IDEA_, _CLion_ & _QtCreator_ as my IDEs, and **_git_** as VCS

- I prefer thinner items, therefore business laptops would have higher probability to be chosen. I work with
  ~~_ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 6_~~ (broken 4 times in 1 year, retired), **_MacBook
  Air 2022 (M2)_**, ~~_DELL XPS 13 9370_(retired due to performance)~~, _Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro (14'' AMD)_ ~~and _MSI GS66 2020_ (retired)~~ (Ordered by frequency

## My ~~Research~~ Interest

- Machine Learning & Deep Learning (NLP & CV)
- ~~Programming Language Theory~~
- Other: interested at _Mathematics_, _Public Health_ and _Epidemiology_, may try to get _MPH/PGDip/PGCert_ degree after finishing CS courses
