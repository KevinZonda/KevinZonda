## About Me

- I am a _Second Year B.Sc. Computer Science student @ University of Birmingham_
- ~~I may look for a PhD position 1.5 years later~~
- I am currently working as _Architect & Dev @ Treehollow_
- I have _basic understanding_ and _beginner's experience_ on  _C#_ and _Golang_, i.e. you can assume that I can't code
- I have an _entry level understanding_ of _RDBMS_ (e.g. _MySQL_ and _PostgreSQL_) and _NoSQL_ (e.g. _Redis_),
  and am current doing _Cassandra_ and _MongoDB_ with _gorm_
- I speak _Mandarin (zh-CN)_, _British English (en-GB)_, _Chinglish (en-CN)_ and quite bit _Cantonese (zh-HK)_
- I can't _regex_, _html_, _css_ and _JavaScript_, I feel sorry about this (but can do a little _TypeScript_)
- I use _Visual Studio_, _Goland_, _Rider_ and _IdeaJ_ as my IDEs, and _git_ as VCS
- I use _Windows 10 x64_, _Debian x64_ and _Manjaro x64_ as my system environment ~~, BTW, I don't use Arch~~
- I prefer thinner items, therefore business laptops would have higher probability to be chosen. I work with
  my favourate ~~_ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 6_~~ (Fine, broken 3 times less than 1 year, so no more apply), _MacBook
  Air 2022 (M2)_, _Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro (14'' AMD)_ as _CLC (Central Linux Compiler, see also
  [CLC | KevinZonda](https://compiler.kevinzonda.com))_ ~~and _MSI GS66 2020_ (retired)~~ (Ordered by frequency
  of use)


## My Interest

- Machine Learning & Artificial Inteligent: currently learning it
- Programming Language: I am creating my own language following some instructions
- Programming: I am quite passionate about it and practicing it
- Other: interested at _Mathematics_, _Public Health_ and _Epidemiology_, may try to get _MPH/PGDip/PGCert_ degree after finishing CS courses
